DIVIDES:
Let x and y be two integers. Then x divides y if there is an integer k such that y = kx. This is denoted as x|y in number theory, and as y/x in standard arithmetic notation.

The value of integer k is the same as the quotient.

DIVIDING LINEAR COMBINATIONS:
This rule can be extrapolated to determine whether or not linear combinations can be divided or not. Let x, y, and z be integers. If x|y and x|z, then x|(ay + bz) for any integers a and b. For instance, (7*18 + 14*17) is divisible by 7 because it is a common factor in both terms of the polynomial, specifically for multiplication operands 7 and 14.

THE DIVISION ALGORITHM:
Let n be an integer and let d be a positive integer. Then, there are unique integers q and r, with 0 ≤ r ≤ d - 1, such that n = qd + r.

The value of integer q is the quotient, while the value of integer r is the remainder. Division operations yield a quotient and modulo operations yield a remainder.

NEGATIVE NUMERATORS:
It is incredibly important to note that dividing a negative number is very different than dividing a positive one. Dividing a positive number simply requires subtracting the divisor from the dividend until the remainder is less than the quotient. Dividing a negative number requires you to add the divisor to the dividend until the remainder is greater than or equal to zero.

For instance, -13 divided by 6 in integer division is -3. This is because the remainder does not become greater than or equal to zero until the divisor 6 is added to -13 three (3) times. This is converted into -3 to keep the shape n = qd + r intact. Since the remainder is 5 here, we simply add that to the rest to get our division algorithm equation:

(-3 * 6) + 5

The summary is to overshoot the quotient for negative numbers and subtract the remainder, and undershoot the quotient for positive numbers and add the remainder.
