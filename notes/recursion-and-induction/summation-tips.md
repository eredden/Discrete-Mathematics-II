### SUMMATION TIPS

You already know sigma notation and all that jazz. These notes are reduced to only the most important things you need to know.

#### Pulling out the final term from a summation:
It is sometimes useful to pull out or add in the final term from a summation. This is displayed below.
```
  n              n-1
  Σ  a sub k  =    Σ a sub k + (n + 1), for k ≥ m
k=m              k=m
```

#### Closed forms for sums:

A closed form for a sum is a mathematical expression that expresses the value of the sum without summation notation. There are closed form expressions for some, although not all, of the summations that arise naturally in scientific applications. For example:
- CLOSED FORM, ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE: **an + (d(n - 1) * n / 2)**
- CLOSED FORM, GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE: **a(r^n - 1) / (r - 1)**

a is the initial term a<sub>0</sub>, d is the difference between a<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n-1</sub>, r is the ratio between a<sub>n</sub> and a<sub>n-1</sub>, and n is the total number of terms in the sequence (**UPPER LIMIT + 1 - LOWER LIMIT**).

#### Substituting values in summations:
You can substitute variables in summations to make things simpler.
