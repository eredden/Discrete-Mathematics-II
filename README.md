## Discrete Mathematics II (WGU C960) Notes

These notes were created by Evan Redden based on zyBooks materials from Western Governors University as well as external resources from Wikipedia and the University of Nebraska. I created this repository for personal use, but I have made it public so that other students can use it as a base for their own studies.

Each folder is associated with one of the units of the zyBooks cirriculum in WGU. The topics I already knew may be omitted in my documents.
