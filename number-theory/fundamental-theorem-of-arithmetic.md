### THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF ARITHMETIC:
**Every positive integer other than 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of prime numbers where the prime factors are written in non-decreasing order.**

Note that **a non-decreasing sequence is one where each prime factor (i.e. operand) is equal to or greater than the one before it.** 120 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 is a valid non-decreasing sequence, while 120 = 2 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 5 is not.

**The multiplicity of a prime factor p is the number of times that p appears in the product of primes.** For the prime factorization of 120 shown above, the multiplicity of 2 would be 3. Exponential notation can be used to represent this, as shown by 120 = 2<sup>3</sup> * 3 * 5.

This theorem allows for number theory to focus on prime positive integers rather than focusing on all positive integers, as almost all positive integers have prime factors aside from 1. **1 is not considered a prime number.**
