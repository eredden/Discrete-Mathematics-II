## PRODUCT RULE

#### DESCRIPTION
If two events are not mutually exclusive (we can do them separately), then we can apply the product rule to see the combinations.

#### THEOREM:
Suppose a procedure can be accomplished with two disjoint subtasks. If there are n<sub>1</sub> ways of doing the first task and n<sub>2</sub> ways of doing the second, then there are **n<sub>1</sub> * n<sub>2</sub>** ways of doing the overall procedure.


## SUM RULE

#### DESCRIPTION
If two events are mutually exclusive (we cannot do them at the same time), then we can apply the sum rule to see the combinations:

#### THEOREM:
Suppose a procedure can be accomplished with two mutually exclusive subtasks. If there are n<sub>1</sub> ways of doing the first task and n<sub>2</sub> ways of doing the second, then there are **n<sub>1</sub> + n<sub>2</sub>** ways of doing the overall procedure.

#### ALTERNATIVE THEOREM:
There is a natural generalization to any sequence of m tasks; namely the number of ways m mutually exclusive events can occur is **n<sub>1</sub> +n<sub>2</sub> + ... + n<sub>m</sub>**.

We can give another formulation in terms of sets. Let **A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>m</sub>** be pairwise *disjoint* sets. Then: 

**| A<sub>1</sub> ∪ A<sub>2</sub> ∪ ... ∪ A<sub>m</sub> | = | A<sub>1</sub> | + | A<sub>2</sub>| + ... + | A<sub>m</sub> |**
